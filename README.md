# CONNECT FOUR
## Approach

1. Map out the game approach
2. Create the TDD tests 
3. Start solving the tests!
4. Finish???


### Small Notes
1. This is a 2 player game, not computer driven. Therefore, don't need to create computer logic
2. It's probably not too hard to construct the win conditions myself, right?
3. Remember the board is a 7x6 (CxR) construction
